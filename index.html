            <h2>What is Restorative Yoga?</h2>
            <p>
                Restorative yoga is a shape of yoga that focuses on relaxation. It is a passive practice involving props to support the body in deep peace and stillness. Unlike other yoga styles that focus on movement and strengthening, restorative yoga is about slowing down and allowing the body to release tension and stress.
            </p><p>  
                The basic principles of restorative yoga center around relaxation, stillness, and props to support the body in each pose. This practice encourages deep breathing, mindfulness, and self-awareness. Using equipment such as blankets, bolsters, and blocks, the body can fully relax into each pose, which can help to release tension and promote healing.
            </p><p>      
                The poses used in restorative yoga are designed to help the body relax and restore. Some of the most common poses include the Supported Child’s Pose, Supported Bridge Pose, Legs Up the Wall Pose, and Supported Reclining Bound Angle Pose. Each pose is held for several minutes, allowing the body to relax and release tension.
            </p><p>      
                Restorative yoga differs from other yoga styles because it is a passive practice focusing on relaxation and stillness. Different yoga styles like Vinyasa or Power Yoga focus on movement and strength-building. Restorative yoga is also accessible to individuals of all levels and abilities, making it an excellent practice for beginners and those with injuries or physical limitations.</p>
